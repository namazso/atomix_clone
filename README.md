### nAtomix

nAtomix is a barebones C clone of the ATARI game Atomix. It was made as a university C course homework, under approx. 3 days.

## Requirements for compiling

* Windows
* C99 compilant compiler
* Tested under: clang 4.0, MSVC 2017

## Install

* Just build the Visual Studio solution with VS or nmake.

## Known issues

Map packs other than the original may not work, due to me not having atom images for those.
If you make them you can add them in easily in atom.c
